# Finding Purpose in Diverse Work

One of the most common questions I receive is how I navigate such diverse career interests - from IT support to agriculture to worship ministry. The answer lies in understanding that all work, when approached with the right heart, can be a form of service.

## A Holistic Approach to Work

### Technology as Service
In IT support, I see every technical problem as an opportunity to serve someone. Whether it's helping a colleague access their email or troubleshooting a complex system issue, the goal is always to make someone's day a little easier.

### Agriculture as Stewardship
Agriculture isn't just about growing crops - it's about stewarding the land God has entrusted to us. Every decision about soil health, water usage, and crop rotation reflects our responsibility to care for creation.

### Recycling as Redemption
Working with plastic recycling has taught me about the beauty of redemption. What others see as waste, we see as potential. It's a powerful metaphor for how God can transform broken things into something valuable.

## The Common Thread

Across all these areas, the common thread is service. Whether I'm helping someone with a computer problem, tending to crops, or leading worship, I'm ultimately serving others and honoring the gifts I've been given.

## Building Bridges

I believe that diverse experiences create bridges between different communities. My work in technology helps me connect with urban professionals, while my agricultural experience allows me to relate to rural communities. This cross-pollination of ideas and values is essential for building a more connected world.
